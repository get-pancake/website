# Brain replacement verification — September 11, 2026

Code revision: `b948d0ad71ace6cd7b22c3314c353bf44d7260a6`.
Draft review: https://github.com/get-pancake/website/pull/295.

## Design and browser checks

- Compared the live Brain page and current `getpancake.ai` in Codex Browser.
- Reused the current v3 foundation, Geist reading face, Aeonik Condensed display
  faces, logo assets, exact button paths/effects, rainbow renderers and step animations.
- Desktop viewport: 1280 × 720. Mobile viewport: 325 × 927.
- Confirmed computed heading/body fonts, no horizontal overflow, intact assets,
  mobile signup anchor and input, corrected pricing currency wrap, and footer.
- No console errors in the checked production-built local page.
- Kept existing Brain marketing text and destinations. Privacy/Terms hash placeholders
  now link to the main site's actual legal pages.

## Automated checks

`npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `git diff --check` pass.
Build retains only the existing Next image advisory for the shared SVG assets.

17 regression tests cover the pinned attribution artifact, every supported UTM
and click identifier (including provider `click_id`), cookie scope/lifetime,
identity/history retention, preview isolation, query privacy, credentialed auth
requests, 204 magic-link success, Google nonce/login contract, and failure/retry
handling. Tests use VM cookies and mocked fetch; they do not create accounts.

## Remaining production verification

No live signup was submitted and no backend conversion postback was sent.
Real email/Google signup, parent-domain cookie handoff and provider delivery must
be checked on `brain.getpancake.ai` during the manual cutover. The current backend
does not allow arbitrary Vercel preview origins. LeadJourney backend routing was
not modified; its pending source-gating work is tracked separately in CMO PR #881.

The production domain and provider-managed DNS remain unchanged. Follow the
Production rebuild and Terraform/DNS steps in the app README when approved.
